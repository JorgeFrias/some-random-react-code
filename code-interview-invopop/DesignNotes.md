# About the design and implementation notes

## Buttons
### Primary Button Component
- The design doesn't contemplate a hover state, I added one.
- The design isn't consistent in the font weight of the buttons, I left the boldest one, as it's the most prominent (good for a call to action). This is a 800, the design also uses a 350 for a button that seems to be equal.

# General elements
- The dividers are not consistent, I choose the one that uses opacity as can work better over different backgrounds.
